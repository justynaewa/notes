Specs for the program (from user's perspective):
- I would like to enter few sentences at the time (one by one)
- I would like to cipher and decipher
- I would like to choose the shift of cipher
- Software should distinguish between small and capital letters
- Software should not vrasg on z/Z when coding/decoding
- Software should deal with blank spaces and very long sentences



What if shift is 20? -45? Will it work?
What happens with "Z" and punctuation?
